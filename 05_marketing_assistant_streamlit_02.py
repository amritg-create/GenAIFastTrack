# RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG)

# GOAL: ADD CHAT INTERFACE FOR CONVERSATIONAL INTERFACE

# streamlit run 05_marketing_assistant_streamlit_02.py

# APP #2: Add Chat Interface
# - Users can now have multiple questions (not limited to single submission)
# - PROBLEM: RAG and memory are not connected


# Key Modifications:
#  1. Persistent Chat History: Utilizing Streamlit's session state, this setup remembers past messages across reruns of the app. Each user interaction and the corresponding assistant response are appended to a message list.
#  2. Using Chat Components for Display: Each message, whether from the user or the AI assistant, is displayed within a st.chat_message context, clearly distinguishing between the participants.
